1. Bring in the raw data file [X]
2. Bring in the term list [X]
4. create a regex for each key in our dictionary(potentially some weird neat cool regex that will match all them) [X]
5. input regex key in our findall() for each dict key [X]
6. increment to the dictionary for each occurrence of key [X]
7. write the counts+terms to new file (csv) []
